# Introduction

Within the cell, the localization of a given protein is determined by its biological 
function. Subcellular proteomics is the method to study  protein sub-cellular 
localization in a systematic manner. There are two complementary ways to analysis localized proteins: 

- On one hand biochemical sub-cellular fractionation experiments allow  empirical quantification of protein across sub-cellular and sub-organellar compartments. Proteins are allocated to a given subcellular niche
if the detected intensity is higher than a threshold. We can say that this type of data has high signal-to-noise ratio, but is available in limited amounts (*primary* data).

- On the other hand, databases such as [GO](http://geneontology.org/) contain large amount of information about sub-cellular proteins localisation, but this is information is blended for a many biological systems. We can say that this type of data has high low signal-to-noise, but is available in large amounts (*auxiliary* data).

So we want to know _how to optimally combine_ primary and auxiliary data.`r emo::ji("chart")`

To do so, we need to weight both types of data. If we imagine a multivariate
distribution (like a [Dirichlet distribution](https://github.com/TommyJones/tidylda)) were all the components take values between (0,1) and all values sum up to one, we can imagine that a weight of 1 indicates that the final annotation rely exclusively on the experimental data and ignore completely the auxiliary data and a weight of 0 represents the opposite situation, where the primary data is ignored and only the auxiliary data is considered.

We could use a *transfer learning* algorithm to efficiently complement the primary data with auxiliary data  without compromising the integrity of the former. This is implemented in the `pRoloc` package and it was published by [Breckels et al](https://lgatto.github.io/pRoloc/reference/knntlClassification.html) and expanded by
[Crook et al](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006516) using a Bayesian approach. In this post I will step-by-step walk through KNN transfer learning. 

# Getting the data
We start with  `HEK293T2011` proteomics data available in the `r Biocexptpkg("pRolocdata")` package.

```{r}
data(HEK293T2011)
```

The class of (HEK293T2011) is`r class(HEK293T2011)`  instance, an efficient and established to [store and handle MS data and metainformation efficiently](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnbase.html). I am not going to discuss much about this class of objects since the field is moving towards other types of data storage such as  [SummarizedExperiment objects](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SummarizedExperiment.html)

We can also get an overview experimental data and query how many proteins across how many conditions were quantified. 
```{r}
head(exprs(HEK293T2011),2)
dim(exprs(HEK293T2011))
```
What is important to know is that 1371 proteins were quantified across eight iTRAQ 8-plex labelled fractions (
one could know a bit more about the experiment with `?HEK293T2011`)


Next thing we can do is see how well these organelles have been resolved in the experiment using a PCA plot
```{r, fig.cap = "PCA plot of `HEK293T2011 subcellular proteomics dataset`"}
plot2D(HEK293T2011)
addLegend(HEK293T2011, where = "topright", cex = 0.6)
```

We see that some organelles such as cytosol and cytosol/nucleus are well resolved - and so they will get a high weigh- while others such as the Golgi or the ER are less so - so they will get a low weight. 
There are some proteins that do not get annotation because the resolution of the experiment did not allow so. 

# Quetting auxiliary annotation (Biomart Query) 

Next thing we can do is get auxiliary data. We can do so by querying `r Biocpkg("biomaRt")` and storing the annotation as an `AnnotationParams` object. Again, this is part of the `r Biocpkg("pRoloc")` package, and it has been created for efficient data handling. 

```{r}
ap <- setAnnotationParams(inputs =
                              c("Human genes",
                                "UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID"))
```
We can access this instance with  
```{r}
getAnnotationParams()
```

We can annotate our innitial `HEK293T2011` data by creating a new `MSnSet` instance populated with a GO term as a binary matrix (so the auxiliary data with information about 889 cellular compartment GO terms has been added).
```{r, eval=FALSE}
HEK293T2011goset  <- makeGoSet(HEK293T2011)

```


# Nearest neighbour transfer learning

## Deciding the weight 
We could define more or less weight values between 0 and 1 depending on how granular we want to be with 
our search (more weight will give finer-grained integration).For example for 3 classes, 3 weights will generate:
```{r}
gtools::permutations(length(seq(0, 1, 0.5)), 3, seq(0, 1, 0.5), repeats.allowed = TRUE) 
```

As we sayed before, HEK293T2011goset experiment has 10 subcellular compartments, and so the total combinations for 10 classes, 4 weights will be:
```{r}
th <- gtools::permutations(length(seq(0, 1, length.out = 4)), 10, seq(0, 1, length.out = 4), repeats.allowed = TRUE)
```
Total combination of weights for HEK293T2011goset experiment will be `r dim(th)[1]`.

`r Biocpkg("pRoloc")` package comes with a convenient function `thetas` to produce such a weight matrix (because we need a  theta for each of the training feature).
```{r}
## marker classes for HEK293T2011
m <- unique(fData(HEK293T2011)$markers.tl)
m <- m[m != "unknown"]
th <- thetas(length(m), length.out=4)
```


## Optimizing weigth 
We can do a grid search to determine which is the best `th`, with the `knntlOptimisation` function of the `r Biocpkg("pRoloc")` package. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
topt <- knntlOptimisation(HEK293T2011, HEK293T2011goset,
                          th = th,
                          k = c(3, 3),
                          fcol = "markers.tl",
                          times = 50, 
                          method = "Breckels" )
```

For the sake of time, we can reduce our initial data, as it will take a long time to do this grid search (even if `knntlOptimisation` uses parallelisation by default).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(2021)
i <- sample(nrow(th), 50)
topt <- knntlOptimisation(HEK293T2011, HEK293T2011goset,
                          th = th[i, ],
                          k = c(3, 3),
                          fcol = "markers.tl",
                          times = 5)
```
The optimisation is performed on the labelled marker examples only. `topt` result stores all the result from the optimisation step, and in particular the observed theta weights, which can be directly plotted as shown on the bubble plot.

```{r fig.cap = "Result stores for the reduced optimisation step", eval=FALSE} 
plot(topt)
```
![Result stocores for the optimisation step. Note that this figure is the result using extensive optimisation on the whole HEK293T2011 dataset and auxiliary HEK293T2011goset dataset, not only with only a random subset of 50 candidate weights.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lgatto/pRoloc/master/vignettes/Figures/bubble-andy.png)

We see that the cytosol and cytosol/nucleus and ER  are predominantly scored with high heights, consistent with high reliability of the primary data. Golgi, PM and the 40S ribosomal clusters are scored with smaller scores, indicating a substantial benefit of the auxiliary data.

The best grid search parameters can be accessed with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
getParams(topt)
```

Note that the data `HEK293T2011` _gets annotated_ with the best parameters at the knntlOptimisation
step. We can get the best weights with:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
bw <- experimentData(HEK293T2011)@other$knntl$thetas
```

## Performing transfer learning

To apply the best weights and learn from the auxiliary data to classify the unlabelled proteins into sub-cellular niches (present in `markers.tl` column), we can pass the primary and auxiliary data sets, best weights, best kâ€™s and the metadata feature data taht contains the markers definitions to the `knntlClassification` function. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
HEK293T2011 <- knntlClassification(HEK293T2011, HEK293T2011goset,
                                bestTheta = bw,
                                k = c(3, 3),
                                fcol = "markers.tl")
```
In this step, annotation predictors scores and parameters get added into the MSnSet data. We can access the predicted localization conveniently using the `getPredictions` assessor.
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
head(fData(HEK293T2011)$knntl)
head(fData(HEK293T2011)$knntl.scores)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
HEK293T2011 <- getPredictions(HEK293T2011, fcol = "knntl")
```

## Plotting the results

```{r HEK293T2011-TL , fig.width=6, fig.height=6, fig.cap = "PCA plot of `HEK293T2011` after transfer learning classification. The size of the points is proportional to the classification scores.", eval=FALSE}

# These functions allow to get/set the colours/points to plot organelle features 
setStockcol(paste0(getStockcol(), "80"))
#this defines the point size
ptsze <- exp(fData(HEK293T2011)$knntl.scores) - 1
plot2D(HEK293T2011, fcol = "knntl", cex = ptsze)
setStockcol(NULL)
addLegend(HEK293T2011, where = "topright",
          fcol = "markers.tl",
          bty = "n", cex = .7)
```

# Conclusions

A *weighted k-nearest neighbor transfer learning* algorithm can be very useful to predict of protein
sub-cellular localisation using quantitative proteomics data as primary data source and Gene Ontology-derived binary data as auxiliary data source.
