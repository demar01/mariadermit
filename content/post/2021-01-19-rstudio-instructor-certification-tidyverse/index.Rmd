# Fundations of my motivation

Early 2020, in a pre-pandemic world, I attended my first [Rladies meetup in London](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/tidy-up-ds/2020-02-london/tidy-up.html#1) by 
[Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel](https://education.rstudio.com/author/mine/). Part of the reasons I decided to attended was because my husband was going to be away for the foreseeable months, so I decided to give myself the chance to connect with other Rladies. It was only few months before that meetup that I started using the Tidyverse, although I used R for many years in the past. It was a fantastic talk where I met some very cool Rladies and I got super impressed by Mine's teaching abilities. 

During the past year, and because of continous lockdowns and WFH, I really dived into the Tidyverse: I joint LatinR talks, participated in Rladies Barcelona Florence Nightingale content, I watched Tidytuesday screencasts, opened a blog with Hugo, Rblogdown and Netlify (thanks to the amazing resources shared by [Alison Hill](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/hill+alison/)). I could easily say that the Tidyverse mission `r emo::ji("space")` keep my mental health afloat during such difficult times. 

Moreover, during the summer of 2020 I got some formal teaching training from university of London where I learn concepts like Blooms taxonomy and I started to give by-weekly workshops for biology researcher co-workers of mine where I introduce them to ggplot2 and statistical concepts such as correlation.

All these things had a direct impact on my research career; for instance I published my 
first R package and gave my first EuroBioconductor [short talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16WN2ldl0r4f5Iv1pR5DAdSIC29H5JcM1Dr0RrYH9qx4/edit#slide=id.p).

# Why I decided to become an RStudio Tidyverse

I decided to get certificated for several reasons: 

1. Getting additional formal training on how to teach. I felt I and my audience could benefit more the better trained for training I would be. 
2. Pushing myself to really know inside out the Tidyverse. Getting the training forced me to read the R4DS book and doing the exercises thoroughly. I used additional fantastic resources such as [https://datasciencebox.org/](https://datasciencebox.org/). Later, I learn that there are book clubs for some of the most popular R books, something that I somewhat missed, but I am very excited to join in 2021 the tidymodels book club organised by [Jon Harmon](https://twitter.com/JonTheGeek).

The RStudio Instructor training journey has properly equipped me to do and teach data science! This process pushed me out of my comfort zone for which I will be forever grateful.

# During the training 
- **Instructor training covering modern teaching methods**. Materials for this training are [available here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ohFt3D0EJ5PDbMaWTxnHH-hwA7G0IvY)

This was a two half days course where [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/) lead such inspiring modules. What I like the most was feeling part of the learning community, the interactivity of the modules and genuinely learning about evidence-based effective teaching methods.

# Between training and exam

## Materials
1. **Books**. 
Reading the book [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/) written by Greg. The book is currently undergoing translation into Spanish by a team of volunteers and I am honored to be among them thanks to [Yanina Bellini Saibene](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/bellini_saibene+yanina/).

2. **Guides**.
Going through [R4DS instructor's guide](https://github.com/rstudio-education/r4ds-instructors) which has learning objectives and key points for each chapter of R4DS book.

3. **Concept maps**.
Building concept maps to design lessons taking into account cognitive load is a big part of the training. When preparing for the two exams I found [this resource](https://github.com/rstudio/concept-maps/tree/master/es) extremely useful to check I was building an accurate mental model of the topics covered in R4DS. I built myself quite a lot of mental models that you can find here 

Greg also asked us to send an email with what we remember and so I did this concept map (there is a lot of information buried beneath my bad hand writing)

4. **Watching and reading other people's experiences**.

- [Process to become a certified Rstudio instructor]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJmfXYd0hOU&feature=emb_logo) a video where some Mi-useRs [(minority R users)](https://medium.com/@doritolay/introducing-mir-a-community-for-underrepresented-users-of-r-7560def7d861) talk about their experiences and motivations to become a certified Rstudio instructor.

- [Obtaining RStudio certification. A shared path](https://yabellini.netlify.app/post/rstudiocertification/) a post by Yanina on her journey to obtain RStudio certification.

- [Reflections](https://bcullen.rbind.io/post/2020-09-03-reflections-on-rstudio-instructor-training/) by [Brendan Cullen's](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/cullen+brendan/) on RStudio Instructor Training .

- [Overview](https://silvia.rbind.io/2020-10-07-rstudio-instructor-certification-tidyverse/) by [Silvia Canelon](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/canelon+silvia/) 
of the RStudio Instructor certification process. Check her post since she has an amazing  collection of resources to support anyone on their certification journey.

5. **Active learning **.

- With some of the materials I use during my learning, I created some exercises using the [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package, which is such a powerful and versatile way to create interactive exercises.
[This](https://clif.shinyapps.io/01-Replacement-es/) is my humble contribution to fading exercises with [Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) and I hope to extend these materials in [user!2021](https://user2021.r-project.org/) later this year

- I also gave a mocked presentation to [Riva Quiroga](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/quiroga+riva/) and [Yanina Bellini](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/bellini_saibene+yanina/) over Zoom and received extremely useful feedback. Gracias chicas!!


# During the teaching exam
2. A 90-minute **teaching exam** based on content from the instructor training. This includes a 15-minute demonstration lesson and a written component. Mine was on [RStudio projects](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html) and my learner persona was [Lovorka](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11CN4Ox8k-zeFEoXJYkbWTNN0V94pyS-T8oHMmBG34xU/edit#slide=id.ga7003f49f1_0_78). You can see my contribution [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/124emaF1lpe4PwVC2zy2bxN1-ckGynlPBkFxVRh7a0r8/edit).


# During the Tidyverse exam

3. A 90-minute **Tidyverse exam** to test your knowledge of the subject matter in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (make sure to check the [program FAQs](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/#faq) for information about the Shiny exam). I hope to share my exercise soon. 

# Voil√†!
