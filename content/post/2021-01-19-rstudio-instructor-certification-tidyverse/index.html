<h1>Fundations of my motivation</h1>
<p>Early 2020, in a pre-pandemic world, I attended my first <a href="https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/tidy-up-ds/2020-02-london/tidy-up.html#1">Rladies meetup in London</a> by
<a href="https://education.rstudio.com/author/mine/">Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel</a>. Part of the reasons I decided to attended was because my husband was going to be away for the foreseeable months, so I decided to give myself the chance to connect with other Rladies. It was only few months before that meetup that I started using the Tidyverse, although I used R for many years in the past. It was a fantastic talk where I met some very cool Rladies and I got super impressed by Mine‚Äôs teaching abilities.</p>
<p>During the past year, and because of continous lockdowns and WFH, I really dived into the Tidyverse: I joint LatinR talks, participated in Rladies Barcelona Florence Nightingale content, I watched Tidytuesday screencasts, opened a blog with Hugo, Rblogdown and Netlify (thanks to the amazing resources shared by <a href="https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/hill+alison/">Alison Hill</a>). I could easily say that the Tidyverse mission üöÄ keep my mental health afloat during such difficult times.</p>
<p>Moreover, during the summer of 2020 I got some formal teaching training from university of London where I learn concepts like Blooms taxonomy and I started to give by-weekly workshops for biology researcher co-workers of mine where I introduce them to ggplot2 and statistical concepts such as correlation.</p>
<p>All these things had a direct impact on my research career; for instance I published my
first R package and gave my first EuroBioconductor <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16WN2ldl0r4f5Iv1pR5DAdSIC29H5JcM1Dr0RrYH9qx4/edit#slide=id.p">short talk</a>.</p>

<div id="why-i-decided-to-become-an-rstudio-tidyverse" class="section level1">
<h1>Why I decided to become an RStudio Tidyverse</h1>
<p>I decided to get certificated for several reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Getting additional formal training on how to teach. I felt I and my audience could benefit more the better trained for training I would be.</li>
<li>Pushing myself to really know inside out the Tidyverse. Getting the training forced me to read the R4DS book and doing the exercises thoroughly. I used additional fantastic resources such as <a href="https://datasciencebox.org/">https://datasciencebox.org/</a>. Later, I learn that there are book clubs for some of the most popular R books, something that I somewhat missed, but I am very excited to join in 2021 the tidymodels book club organised by <a href="https://twitter.com/JonTheGeek">Jon Harmon</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The RStudio Instructor training journey has properly equipped me to do and teach data science! This process pushed me out of my comfort zone for which I will be forever grateful.</p>

<div id="during-the-training" class="section level1">
<h1>During the training</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Instructor training covering modern teaching methods</strong>. Materials for this training are <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ohFt3D0EJ5PDbMaWTxnHH-hwA7G0IvY">available here</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This was a two half days course where <a href="https://third-bit.com/">Greg Wilson</a> lead such inspiring modules. What I like the most was feeling part of the learning community, the interactivity of the modules and genuinely learning about evidence-based effective teaching methods.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Books</strong>.
Reading the book <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/">Teaching Tech Together</a> written by Greg. The book is currently undergoing translation into Spanish by a team of volunteers and I am honored to be among them thanks to <a href="https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/bellini_saibene+yanina/">Yanina Bellini Saibene</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Guides</strong>.
Going through <a href="https://github.com/rstudio-education/r4ds-instructors">R4DS instructor‚Äôs guide</a> which has learning objectives and key points for each chapter of R4DS book.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Concept maps</strong>.
Building concept maps to design lessons taking into account cognitive load is a big part of the training. When preparing for the two exams I found <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/concept-maps/tree/master/es">this resource</a> extremely useful to check I was building an accurate mental model of the topics covered in R4DS. I built myself quite a lot of mental models that you can find here</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Greg also asked us to send an email with what we remember and so I did this concept map (there is a lot of information buried beneath my bad hand writing)</p>

<li><strong>Active learning </strong>.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>With some of the materials I use during my learning, I created some exercises using the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/">learnr</a> package, which is such a powerful and versatile way to create interactive exercises.
<a href="https://clif.shinyapps.io/01-Replacement-es/">This</a> is my humble contribution to fading exercises with <a href="https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins">Penguins</a> and I hope to extend these materials in <a href="https://user2021.r-project.org/">user!2021</a> later this year</p></li>
<li><p>I also gave a mocked presentation to <a href="https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/quiroga+riva/">Riva Quiroga</a> and <a href="https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/bellini_saibene+yanina/">Yanina Bellini</a> over Zoom and received extremely useful feedback. Gracias chicas!!</p></li>
