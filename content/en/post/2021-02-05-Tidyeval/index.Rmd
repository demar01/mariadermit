```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
```

```{r import, results=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(rlang)
library(tidyverse)
library(testthat)
```

# Motivation
Provide some examples of using [Tidy evaluation](https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org/) (also called non-standard evaluation (NSE) or **delayed evaluation**).

`r emo::ji("information")` This post may be useful for your if you have read [Chapters 17-20 of Advanced R book ](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/metaprogramming.html) and you are looking to find more additional examples of Tidyeval. You may also want to have a look at the great Tidyeval resource put together by [Mara](https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/08/tidyeval-resource-roundup/).

Libraries I'm gonna need for this post

```{r}
library(rlang)
library(tidyverse)
library(testthat)
```


# Standard function to coefficient of variation

Let's write a function that calculates coefficient of variation:
```{r function}
cv <- function(var) {
    sd(var) / mean(var)
}
```
We can test that the function is behaving correctly
```{r}
testthat::expect_equal( cv(c(3,3)), 0)
testthat::expect_equal( round(cv(c(3,6)),2), 0.47)
```

Great! The function seems to be doing what we want!

## Capture and uncapture expression
We can capture and uncapture expressions with [`enexpr` and bang-bang !!](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/quasiquotation.html)
```{r capture-uncapture}
cv <- function(var) {
    var <- enexpr(var) 
    expr(sd(!!var) / mean(!!var)) 
}
```
There is a lot is going on here:

- **enexpr**: it captures what the caller supplied to the function and allows delayed evaluation.
- **!!**: it unquotes. Sort of like make available what it was captured by enexpr. No evaluation has happened yet.
- **expr**: it captures what it was unquoted by !!. No evaluation has happened yet.

Let's see what happens:
```{r}
testthat::expect_equal(eval(cv(c(3,3))), 0) 
testthat::expect_type((cv(c(3,3))), "language")
```
If we evaluate the function, the cv is equal to 0. Note that we **have delayed the evaluation** up the point when used eval.

If we don't evaluate the function it remains as a [call object](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/expressions.html#calls).

# Modiying the enviroment - no issues

Let's modify the function's environment a little:
```{r capture-uncapture-2}
cv <- function(var) {
    x=6
    var <- enexpr(var)
    expr(sd(!!var) / mean(!!var))
}
```
Let's see what happens:
```{r}
x=3
testthat::expect_equal( eval(cv(c(3,x))), 0)
x=6
testthat::expect_equal(round(eval(cv(c(3,x))),2), 0.47)
```
This works even if we put x in the environment where the function is written because x is not an argument of cv function. 

# Modiying the enviroment -  ISSUES!

```{r capture-uncapture-df}
adding_cv <- function(df,var) {
    x=c(3,6)
    var <- enexpr(var)
    mutate(df, sd(!!var) / mean(!!var))
}
```
Let's see what happens:
```{r}
df<- tibble(n=3)
x=c(3,3)
adding_cv(df,x)
```
Wait, what?! The new column contains coefficient of variation. If x=c(3,3) the value in the new column should have been 0. However adding_cv is using x=c(3,6) included in the function environment and not x=c(3,3).

# Capturing with enquo

To capture the function and the environment we need [enquo](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/evaluation.html?q=enquo#creating)
```{r}
adding_cv <- function(df,var) {
    x=c(3,6)
    var <- enquo(var)
    mutate(df, sd(!!var) / mean(!!var))
}
```
Let's see what happens now:
```{r}
df<- tibble(n=3)
x=c(3,3)
adding_cv(df,x)
```

# Changing name with :=
We can make the name of the new column prettier with [**:=**](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/quasiquotation.html#tidy-dots)
```{r}
adding_cv <- function(df,var,nm) {
    x=c(3,3)
    nm_name <- quo_name(nm)
    var <- enquo(var)
    mutate(df, !!nm_name:= sd(!!var) / mean(!!var))
}
```
Let's see if that allows changing the name:
```{r}
x=c(3,6)
df<- tibble(n=3)
adding_cv(df,x,"pretty_name")
```

# Insert a list of expressions into a call

What if we want to do _delayed_ filtering? We need to unquote multiple arguments. For this we can use [!!!](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/quasiquotation.html#unquoting-many-arguments)
```{r}
adding_cv <- function(df,var,nm, ...) {
    x=c(3,6)
    nm_name <- quo_name(nm)
    var <- enquo(var)
    filtering <- enquos(...)
    df %>%  filter(!!!filtering) %>% 
    mutate( !!nm_name:= sd(!!var) / mean(!!var))}
```
Let's see if we can filter rows 3 and 6 from column n of our df:
```{r}
df<- tibble(n=c(3,6,9),m=c(3,6,9))
x=c(3,3)
adding_cv(df,x,"pretty_name", n %in% c(3,6))
```

# Conclusions
These were just few examples to illustrate why [tidyeval]([https://tidyeval.tidyverse.org/) can be useful and when it might be needed. I hope it helped you!
