**Hello, and welcome!** I'm a Postdoctoral Research scientist in  [Barts Cancer Institute](https://www.bartscancer.london/). I work in the [Mardakheh Lab](http://www.mardakhehlab.info/) where I use multi-omics approaches, to systematically reveal the relationship between RNA localisation and protein expression in mammalian cells. Learn more about my research interests in [publications](publication).

I enjoy using [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) to optimize my research workflow and I enjoy sharing my experiences in the Tidyverse with others. Keep up with my data exploration using R in [posts](post) and teaching in [talks](talk). **Thanks** for reading!
