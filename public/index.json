We use the emptyDrops() function to test whether the expression profile for each cell barcode is significantly different from the ambient RNA pool. emptyDrops() assumes that barcodes with low total UMI counts are empty droplets. emptyDrops() uses Monte Carlo simulations to compute p-values for the multinomial sampling transcripts from the ambient pool.\nset.seed(100) #seed forreproducible results, emptyDrops performas a simulation. e.out \u0026lt;- emptyDrops(counts(sce.pbmc)) sce.pbmc \u0026lt;- sce.pbmc[,which(e.out$FDR \u0026lt;= 0.001)] #we exclude dropplets that have low UMI counts  These are the unfiltered, non-empty drops\nunfiltered \u0026lt;- sce.pbmc For each cell, we calculate these QC metrics using the perCellQCMetrics() function from the scater package. The sum column contains the total count for each cell and the detected column contains the number of detected genes. Mitochondrial counts are informative, because small mitochondrial percentages, large spike-in percentages and small library sizes are likely to be stripped nuclei, i.e., they have been so extensively damaged that they have lost all cytoplasmic content, therefore are low quality cells. Here we use a relaxed QC strategy and only remove cells with large mitochondrial proportions, using it as a proxy for cell damage. This reduces the risk of removing cell types with low RNA content, especially in a heterogeneous PBMC population with many different cell types.\nstats \u0026lt;- perCellQCMetrics(sce.pbmc, subsets=list(Mito=which(location==\u0026quot;MT\u0026quot;))) high.mito \u0026lt;- isOutlier(stats$subsets_Mito_percent, type=\u0026quot;higher\u0026quot;) sce.pbmc \u0026lt;- sce.pbmc[,!high.mito] summary(high.mito) ## Mode FALSE TRUE ## logical 3985 315 colData(unfiltered) \u0026lt;- cbind(colData(unfiltered), stats) unfiltered$discard \u0026lt;- high.mito gridExtra::grid.arrange( plotColData(unfiltered, y=\u0026quot;sum\u0026quot;, colour_by=\u0026quot;discard\u0026quot;) + scale_y_log10() + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Total count\u0026quot;), plotColData(unfiltered, y=\u0026quot;detected\u0026quot;, colour_by=\u0026quot;discard\u0026quot;) + scale_y_log10() + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Detected features\u0026quot;), plotColData(unfiltered, y=\u0026quot;subsets_Mito_percent\u0026quot;, colour_by=\u0026quot;discard\u0026quot;) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Mito percent\u0026quot;), ncol=2 )  Figure 1: Distribution of various QC metrics in the PBMC dataset after cell calling.

Normalization There are a number of normalization methods. We use a pre-clustering step with quickCluster() where cells in each cluster are normalized separately and the size factors are rescaled to be comparable across clusters. This avoids the assumption that most genes are non-DE across the entire population - only a non-DE majority is required between pairs of clusters, which is a weaker assumption for highly heterogeneous populations. By default, quickCluster() will use an approximate algorithm for PCA based on methods from the irlba package. The approximation relies on stochastic initialization so we need to set the random seed (via set.seed()) for reproducibility. computeSumFactors performs a scaling normalization of single-cell RNA-seq data by deconvolving size factors from cell pools. Once we have computed the size factors, we use the logNormCounts() function from scater to compute normalized expression values for each cell. This is done by dividing the count for each gene/spike-in transcript with the appropriate size factor for that cell. The function also log-transforms the normalized values, creating a new assay called \"logcounts\". (Technically, these are “log-transformed normalized expression values”, but that’s too much of a mouthful to fit into the assay name.) These log-values will be the basis of our downstream analyses.\nlibrary(scran) set.seed(1000) clusters \u0026lt;- quickCluster(sce.pbmc) sce.pbmc \u0026lt;- computeSumFactors(sce.pbmc, cluster=clusters) sce.pbmc \u0026lt;- logNormCounts(sce.pbmc) summary(sizeFactors(sce.pbmc)) ## Min. 1st Qu.

As for bulk RNAseq, library size normalization is the simplest strategy for performing scaling normalization. However, library size normalization is usually sufficient in many applications where the aim is to identify clusters and the top markers that define each cluster.\nplot(librarySizeFactors(sce.pbmc), sizeFactors(sce.pbmc), pch=16, xlab=\u0026quot;Library size factors\u0026quot;, ylab=\u0026quot;Deconvolution factors\u0026quot;, log=\u0026quot;xy\u0026quot;)  Figure 3: Relationship between the library size factors and the deconvolution size factors in the PBMC dataset.   Variance modelling/feature selection Several methods are available to quantify the variation per gene and to select an appropriate set of highly variable genes (HVGs). UMI counts typically exhibit near-Poisson variation if we only consider technical noise from library preparation and sequencing. This can be used to construct a mean-variance trend in the log-counts with the modelGeneVarByPoisson function. We can then select the top 10% of genes with the highest biological components.\nset.seed(1001) dec.pbmc \u0026lt;- modelGeneVarByPoisson(sce.pbmc) top.pbmc \u0026lt;- getTopHVGs(dec.pbmc, prop=0.1) plot(dec.pbmc$mean, dec.pbmc$total, pch=16, cex=0.5, xlab=\u0026quot;Mean of log-expression\u0026quot;, ylab=\u0026quot;Variance of log-expression\u0026quot;) curfit \u0026lt;- metadata(dec.pbmc) curve(curfit$trend(x), col=\u0026#39;dodgerblue\u0026#39;, add=TRUE, lwd=2)  Figure 4: Per-gene variance as a function of the mean for the log-expression values in the PBMC dataset. Each point represents a gene (black) with the mean-variance trend (blue) fitted to simulated Poisson counts.   Dimensionality reduction Now we want to compare cells based on the values of gene expression. We can use denoisePCA function, that “de-noises” log-expression data by removing principal components corresponding to technical noise.\nset.seed(10000) sce.pbmc \u0026lt;- denoisePCA(sce.pbmc, subset.row=top.pbmc, technical=dec.pbmc) set.seed(100000) sce.pbmc \u0026lt;- runTSNE(sce.pbmc, dimred=\u0026quot;PCA\u0026quot;) set.seed(1000000) sce.pbmc \u0026lt;- runUMAP(sce.pbmc, dimred=\u0026quot;PCA\u0026quot;) We verify how many PCs were retained.\nncol(reducedDim(sce.pbmc, \u0026quot;PCA\u0026quot;)) ## [1] 9  Clustering We can now create nearest-neighbor graphs with the buildSNNGraph function and cluster_walktrap function. cluster_walktrap will assign membership of densely connected subgraphs, also called “communities”.\ng \u0026lt;- buildSNNGraph(sce.pbmc, k=10, use.dimred = \u0026#39;PCA\u0026#39;) clust \u0026lt;- igraph::cluster_walktrap(g)$membership colLabels(sce.pbmc) \u0026lt;- factor(clust) table(colLabels(sce.pbmc)) ## ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ## 205 508 541 56 374 125 46 432 302 867 47 155 166 61 84 16 plotTSNE(sce.pbmc, colour_by=\u0026quot;label\u0026quot;)  Figure 5: Obligatory \\(t\\)-SNE plot of the PBMC dataset, where each point represents a cell and is colored according to the assigned cluster.   Interpretation To interpret the clustering results, we need to identify the genes that drive separation between clusters. In the most obvious case, the marker genes for each cluster are a priori associated with particular cell types, allowing us to treat the clustering as a proxy for cell type identity. The same principle can be applied to discover more subtle differences between clusters (e.g., changes in activation or differentiation state) based on the behavior of genes in the affected pathways. We perform pairwise t-tests between clusters for each gene using the findMarkers function, which uses a Welch t-test to perform DE testing between clusters and returns a list of DataFrames containing ranked candidate markers for each cluster.\nmarkers \u0026lt;- findMarkers(sce.pbmc, pval.type=\u0026quot;some\u0026quot;, direction=\u0026quot;up\u0026quot;) Let’s say that we want to examine the markers for cluster 8 in more detail.\nmarker.set \u0026lt;- markers[[\u0026quot;8\u0026quot;]] as.data.frame(marker.set[1:30,1:3]) ## p.value FDR summary.logFC ## CSTA 7.170624e-222 2.015964e-217 2.4178954 ## MNDA 1.196631e-221 2.015964e-217 2.6614935 ## FCN1 2.375980e-213 2.668543e-209 2.6380934 ## S100A12 4.393470e-212 3.700839e-208 3.0808902 ## VCAN 1.711043e-199 1.153038e-195 2.2603760 ## TYMP 1.173532e-154 6.590164e-151 2.0237930 ## AIF1 3.673649e-149 1.768285e-145 2.4603604 ## LGALS2 4.004740e-137 1.686696e-133 1.8927606 ## MS4A6A 5.639909e-134 2.111457e-130 1.5457061 ## FGL2 2.044513e-124 6.888781e-121 1.3859366 ## RP11-1143G9.4 6.891551e-122 2.110945e-118 2.8042347 ## AP1S2 1.786019e-112 5.014842e-109 1.7703547 ## CD14 1.195352e-110 3.098169e-107 1.4259764 ## CFD 6.870490e-109 1.653531e-105 1.3560255 ## GPX1 9.048825e-107 2.032607e-103 2.4013937 ## TNFSF13B 3.920319e-95 8.255701e-92 1.1151275 ## KLF4 3.309726e-94 6.559876e-91 1.2049050 ## GRN 4.801206e-91 8.987324e-88 1.3814668 ## NAMPT 2.489624e-90 4.415020e-87 1.1438687 ## CLEC7A 7.736088e-88 1.303299e-84 1.0616120 ## S100A8 3.124930e-84 5.013875e-81 4.8051993 ## SERPINA1 1.580359e-82 2.420392e-79 1.3842689 ## CD36 8.018347e-79 1.174653e-75 1.0538169 ## MPEG1 8.481588e-79 1.190744e-75 0.9778095 ## CD68 5.118714e-78 6.898798e-75 0.9481203 ## CYBB 1.200516e-77 1.555776e-74 1.0300245 ## S100A11 1.174556e-72 1.465759e-69 1.8962486 ## RBP7 2.467027e-71 2.968714e-68 0.9666127 ## BLVRB 3.762610e-71 4.371634e-68 0.9701168 ## CD302 9.859086e-71 1.107307e-67 0.8792077 The high expression of MNDA, CD14 and CD68 suggests that cluster 8 contains monocytes.\nmarker.set \u0026lt;- markers[[\u0026quot;15\u0026quot;]] as.data.frame(marker.set[1:30,1:3]) ## p.value FDR summary.logFC ## AIF1 6.912466e-82 2.329086e-77 3.678553 ## FCGR3A 3.606603e-64 6.076045e-60 3.041108 ## SERPINA1 6.149257e-64 6.906436e-60 2.375549 ## FTL 2.857395e-63 2.406927e-59 2.061453 ## LST1 4.161324e-62 2.804233e-58 1.892121 ## COTL1 1.582271e-61 8.885507e-58 1.305713 ## CTSS 3.143428e-55 1.513067e-51 1.880227 ## S100A11 1.719244e-54 7.241024e-51 2.030715 ## TYMP 4.395645e-50 1.645632e-46 2.101758 ## MS4A7 7.348647e-48 2.476053e-44 2.173820 ## NAP1L1 2.806622e-47 8.596939e-44 1.142910 ## FTH1 5.856763e-47 1.644481e-43 1.188781 ## CD68 2.661218e-46 6.897469e-43 2.048530 ## STXBP2 5.783395e-45 1.391898e-41 2.075910 ## SAT1 9.269854e-43 2.082256e-39 1.541614 ## TYROBP 3.459416e-42 7.285097e-39 1.152396 ## PSAP 1.582943e-40 3.137392e-37 1.403571 ## CSTB 3.871723e-40 7.247436e-37 1.129131 ## CFD 4.529809e-39 8.033020e-36 1.999696 ## FKBP1A 5.042155e-39 8.494519e-36 1.301575 ## CEBPB 6.875529e-39 1.103162e-35 1.683662 ## LINC01272 7.357858e-38 1.126889e-34 1.840199 ## FCER1G 2.802003e-37 4.104813e-34 1.301967 ## SPI1 9.236815e-36 1.296772e-32 1.890047 ## S100A4 4.102320e-35 5.528943e-32 4.356299 ## NEAT1 5.928869e-33 7.683358e-30 1.358303 ## IFITM3 6.875461e-33 8.580066e-30 1.871086 ## LYZ 8.944290e-32 1.076317e-28 1.804654 ## LRRC25 1.072482e-31 1.246077e-28 1.242115 ## RNASET2 7.560048e-31 8.490942e-28 1.090212 The high expression of FCGR3A suggests that cluster 15 contains macrophagues.\n# Checking the cluster is what we wanted. marker.set \u0026lt;- markers[[\u0026quot;8\u0026quot;]] topset \u0026lt;- rownames(marker.set)[1:30] stopifnot(all(c(\u0026quot;CD14\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;CD68\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MNDA\u0026quot;) %in% topset)) plotExpression(sce.pbmc, features=c(\u0026quot;CD14\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;CD68\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;MNDA\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;FCGR3A\u0026quot;), x=\u0026quot;label\u0026quot;, colour_by=\u0026quot;label\u0026quot;)  Figure 6: Distribution of expression values for monocyte and macrophage markers across clusters in the PBMC dataset.

Capturing with enquo Changing name with := Insert a list of expressions into a call Conclusions   Motivation Provide some examples of using Tidy evaluation (also called non-standard evaluation (NSE) or delayed evaluation).\nℹ️ This post may be useful for your if you have read Chapters 17-20 of Advanced R book and you are looking to find more additional examples of Tidyeval. You may also want to have a look at the great Tidyeval resource put together by Mara.\nLibraries needed for this post\nlibrary(rlang) library(tidyverse) library(testthat)  Standard function to coefficient of variation Let’s write a function that calculates coefficient of variation:\ncv \u0026lt;- function(var) { sd(var) / mean(var) } We can test that the function is behaving correctly\ntestthat::expect_equal( cv(c(3,3)), 0) testthat::expect_equal( round(cv(c(3,6)),2), 0.47) Great! The function seems to be doing what we want! Capture and uncapture expression We can capture and uncapture expressions with enexpr and bang-bang !!\ncv \u0026lt;- function(var) { var \u0026lt;- enexpr(var) expr(sd(!!var) / mean(!!var)) } There is a lot is going on here:\n enexpr: it captures what the caller supplied to the function and allows delayed evaluation. !!: it unquotes. Sort of like make available what it was captured by enexpr. No evaluation has happened yet. expr: it captures what it was unquoted by !!. No evaluation has happened yet.  Let’s see what happens:\ntestthat::expect_equal(eval(cv(c(3,3))), 0) testthat::expect_type((cv(c(3,3))), \u0026quot;language\u0026quot;) If we evaluate the function, the cv is equal to 0. Note that we have delayed the evaluation up the point when used eval.\nIf we don’t evaluate the function it remains as a call object.\n  Modiying the enviroment - no issues Let’s modify the function’s environment a little:\ncv \u0026lt;- function(var) { x=6 var \u0026lt;- enexpr(var) expr(sd(!!var) / mean(!!var)) } Let’s see what happens:\nx=3 testthat::expect_equal( eval(cv(c(3,x))), 0) x=6 testthat::expect_equal(round(eval(cv(c(3,x))),2), 0.47) This works even if we put x in the environment where the function is written because x is not an argument of cv function.\n Modiying the enviroment - ISSUES! adding_cv \u0026lt;- function(df,var) { x=c(3,6) var \u0026lt;- enexpr(var) mutate(df, sd(!!var) / mean(!!var)) } Let’s see what happens:\ndf\u0026lt;- tibble(n=3) x=c(3,3) adding_cv(df,x) ## # A tibble: 1 x 2 ## n `sd(x)/mean(x)` ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 3 0.471 Wait, what?! The new column contains coefficient of variation. If x=c(3,3) the value in the new column should have been 0. However adding_cv is using x=c(3,6) included in the function environment and not x=c(3,3).\n Capturing with enquo To capture the function and the environment we need enquo\nadding_cv \u0026lt;- function(df,var) { x=c(3,6) var \u0026lt;- enquo(var) mutate(df, sd(!!var) / mean(!!var)) } Let’s see what happens now:\ndf\u0026lt;- tibble(n=3) x=c(3,3) adding_cv(df,x) ## # A tibble: 1 x 2 ## n `sd(x)/mean(x)` ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 3 0  Changing name with := We can make the name of the new column prettier with :=\nadding_cv \u0026lt;- function(df,var,nm) { x=c(3,3) nm_name \u0026lt;- quo_name(nm) var \u0026lt;- enquo(var) mutate(df, !!nm_name:= sd(!!var) / mean(!!var)) } Let’s see if that allows changing the name:\nx=c(3,6) df\u0026lt;- tibble(n=3) adding_cv(df,x,\u0026quot;pretty_name\u0026quot;) ## # A tibble: 1 x 2 ## n pretty_name ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 3 0.471  Insert a list of expressions into a call What if we want to do delayed filtering? We need to unquote multiple arguments. For this we can use !!!\nadding_cv \u0026lt;- function(df,var,nm, ...) { x=c(3,6) nm_name \u0026lt;- quo_name(nm) var \u0026lt;- enquo(var) filtering \u0026lt;- enquos(...) df %\u0026gt;% filter(!!!filtering) %\u0026gt;% mutate( !!nm_name:= sd(!!var) / mean(!!var))} Let’s see if we can filter rows 3 and 6 from column n of our df:\ndf\u0026lt;- tibble(n=c(3,6,9),m=c(3,6,9)) x=c(3,3) adding_cv(df,x,\u0026quot;pretty_name\u0026quot;, n %in% c(3,6)) ## # A tibble: 2 x 3 ## n m pretty_name ## \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 3 3 0 ## 2 6 6 0  Conclusions These were just few examples to illustrate why tidyeval can be useful and when it might be needed.

It also looks like one of the olive oils is closer to peanunt type of oil in the PCA space .\n PCA in Tidymodels Modeling is very much like cooking, and in the Tidymodels universe the language is reflects this very well 👩‍🍳. There are three things that we will need to do:\n Writing down a recipe 👩‍🍳 Preparing that recipe 🍝 Juicing the recipe 🍵  Writing down a recipe We write down the recipe by adding series of steps.\npca_rec \u0026lt;- recipe(~., data = oils) %\u0026gt;% # start writing the recipe with all the data update_role(class, new_role = \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% # to keep this column around but not include it in the model step_normalize(all_predictors()) %\u0026gt;% # to normalise the data step_pca(all_predictors()) # to convert numeric data to principal components As we see the steps that we need to follow to write the recipe are very similar to the steps followed in base R. However, this is not all. In fact, if we explore how the recipe looks like:\npca_rec ## Data Recipe ## ## Inputs: ## ## role #variables ## id 1 ## predictor 7 ## ## Operations: ## ## Centering and scaling for all_predictors() ## No PCA components were extracted. We can see that the design matrix with id and predictor variables was created. The recipe tells us that the No PCA components were extracted. This is because a recipe specifies what we want to do, but it doesn’t really do anything to the data yet. We need to extract those components by preparing the recipe.\n Preparing that recipe We can use the function prep for preparing to train this data recipe. Prep returns an updated recipe with the estimates.\npca_prep \u0026lt;- prep(pca_rec) pca_prep ## Data Recipe ## ## Inputs: ## ## role #variables ## id 1 ## predictor 7 ## ## Training data contained 96 data points and no missing data. ## ## Operations: ## ## Centering and scaling for palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, ...

We need to finalise that prepared recipe by juicing it!\n Juicing the recipe We need to apply these operation to the data; juice returns a tibble where all steps have been applied to the data.\npca_juiced \u0026lt;- juice(pca_prep) pca_juiced ## # A tibble: 96 x 6 ## class PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 ## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 pumpkin -1.22 -0.296 -0.245 -0.158 0.0882 ## 2 pumpkin -1.10 -0.771 -0.198 -0.00964 -0.0901 ## 3 pumpkin -1.08 -1.06 -0.212 0.0154 0.00279 ## 4 pumpkin -1.14 -0.266 -0.192 -0.177 -0.137 ## 5 pumpkin -1.25 -0.995 -0.241 0.226 -0.186 ## 6 pumpkin 0.572 -0.500 -0.0821 0.0652 0.286 ## 7 pumpkin -1.13 -0.530 -0.202 -0.0640 -0.0592 ## 8 pumpkin -1.13 -0.530 -0.202 -0.0640 -0.0592 ## 9 pumpkin -1.08 -1.06 -0.212 0.0154 0.00279 ## 10 pumpkin -1.14 -0.266 -0.192 -0.177 -0.137 ## # … with 86 more rows Great!

Note that autoplot adds some information to the plot such as providing PCs percentage. So what’s the point of using Tidymodels if is a such a long series of steps compared to base R? Well, Tidymodels integrates a lot of modular packages which facilitates creating and evaluating different models.\n  UMAP in Tidymodels In addition to PCA, we could plot a UMAP representation. To do that we would need a new recipe, one that includes a step specify UMAP dimension reduction technique; this step is naturally called step_umap. Once that we have this recipe, the process is the same. Recipe, prep, juice.\numap_rec \u0026lt;- recipe(~., data = oils) %\u0026gt;% update_role(class, new_role = \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% step_normalize(all_predictors()) %\u0026gt;% step_umap(all_predictors()) # this step makes a different recipe  umap_prep \u0026lt;- prep(umap_rec) umap_juiced \u0026lt;- juice(umap_prep) umap_juiced %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(umap_1, umap_2, label = class)) + geom_point(aes(color = class), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) + labs(color = NULL) This model separates the data in the space somewhat differently to PCA. PCA and UMAP are fundamentally different in that PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction algorithm whereas UMAP is non-linear. Moreover, there are few important parameters that can impact how the UMAP representation looks like. This is nicely explained in the README of umapr package from the ropenscilabs. You can see additional arguments offered by step_umap with ?step_umap. Also note that we have trained our models with a tiny set of data (we have not done resampling) and we have not evaluated their performance.\n Conclusions The data processing for doing unsupervised machine learning with Tidymodels are very similar to base R. Linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms separate the data in the reduced space differently.\n ","date":1612396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612569600,"objectID":"a3862cc77779342ec65a5fb89707dd2f","permalink":"/2021-02-04-unsupervised-machine-learning-with-tidymodels/","publishdate":"2021-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2021-02-04-unsupervised-machine-learning-with-tidymodels/","section":"post","summary":"Create a recipe, prep it and juice it to do PCA and UMAP with Tidymodels.","tags":["r","modeldata","PCA","UMAP","tidymodels"],"title":"PCA and UMAP classification of vegetable oils with tidymodels \u0026 base R","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"   Motivation Statistics of Bioconductor downloads Full details of Bioconductor packages Word network of Bioconductor packages Conclusions   library(BiocPkgTools) library(tidyverse) library(tidytext) library(widyr) library(igraph) library(ggraph) library(lubridate) library(emo) Motivation Bioconductor has a total of 5796 at the present day 2021-01-31.

We could use this metadata information to understand the connections between packages.\n Word network of Bioconductor packages The most informative variables about the packages are Title and Description so we can explore the connections between packages doing some text mining using a Tidytext approach.\nTo prepare our dataset we need to initially tokenize the text. The Wikipedia definition for tokenization on lexical analysis is as follows:\n Tokenization is the process of demarcating and possibly classifying sections of a string of input characters\n The sections can be words, sentence, ngram or chapter (for example if analysis a book). In this case we are gonna break down package Titles or Description into words using the function unnest_tokens. In addition, we can remove stop words (included in the Tidytext dataset).\nbpi_title \u0026lt;- bpi %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(Package, Title) %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(word, Title) %\u0026gt;% anti_join(stop_words) bpi_description \u0026lt;- bpi %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(Package, Description) %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(word, Description) %\u0026gt;% anti_join(stop_words) Note that the number of words from Title is 11932 and the number of words from Description is 59370, so package Descriptions contain on average 5 times the words of package Titles.\nWe can have a look at how the tokenised titles for each package look like:\nbpi_title ## # A tibble: 11,932 x 2 ## Package word ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 a4 automated ## 2 a4 affymetrix ## 3 a4 array ## 4 a4 analysis ## 5 a4 umbrella ## 6 a4 package ## 7 a4Base automated ## 8 a4Base affymetrix ## 9 a4Base array ## 10 a4Base analysis ## # … with 11,922 more rows Them, we can use pairwise_count from the widyr package to count how many times each pair of words occurs together in the package Title. This function works as a mutate in that it takes the variables to compare and returns a tibble with the pairwise columns and an extra column called n containing the number of words co-occurrences. I think this function is very sweet 🍯!\nbpi_titlepairs \u0026lt;- bpi_title %\u0026gt;% pairwise_count(Package, word, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE) bpi_desciptionpairs \u0026lt;- bpi_description %\u0026gt;% pairwise_count(Package, word, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE) This data is ready for visualization of network of co-occurring words in package Titles. We can use the ggraph package for visualizing this network. We are going to represent just the top co-occurring words, or otherwise we get a very populated network which is impossible to read.\nset.seed(1234) bpi_titlepairs %\u0026gt;% filter(n \u0026gt;= 6) %\u0026gt;% graph_from_data_frame() %\u0026gt;% ggraph(layout = \u0026quot;fr\u0026quot;) + geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n), edge_colour = \u0026quot;purple\u0026quot;) + geom_node_point(size = 5) + geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, point.padding = unit(0.2, \u0026quot;lines\u0026quot;)) + theme_void()+ theme(legend.position=\u0026quot;none\u0026quot;)+ labs(title = \u0026quot; Number of word co-ocurrences in packages titles\u0026quot;)  Figure 1: Word network in Bioconductor packages Titles  We see some clear and logical clustering of packages in this network.For example, DESEq and DESeq2 packages cluster together, as one would expect since they DESeq2 is the successor of DESeq. There are other obvious connections such as MSstatsTMTPTM and MSstatsTMTP since the former has added functionality to analyse PTMs on TMT shotgun mass spectrometry-based proteomic experiments. There is a big cluster on the bottom left corner with packages to analyse RNASeq and single cell RNASeq.\nWhat about the network build from words of the Description?\nset.seed(1234) bpi_desciptionpairs %\u0026gt;% filter(n \u0026gt;= 15) %\u0026gt;% graph_from_data_frame() %\u0026gt;% ggraph(layout = \u0026quot;fr\u0026quot;) + geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n), edge_colour = \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;) + geom_node_point(size = 5) + geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, point.padding = unit(0.2, \u0026quot;lines\u0026quot;)) + theme_void()+ theme(legend.position=\u0026quot;none\u0026quot;)+ labs(title = \u0026quot;Number of word co-ocurrences in packages Description\u0026quot;)  Figure 2: Word network in Bioconductor packages Description  We see more connections here, and some of the relationships are still obvious (e.g HiCcompare and multiHiCcompare, anota and anota2seq, AnnotationHub and ExperimentHub). This network is richer, and one would have to dive a bit deeper to get a better sense of this network.\n Conclusions Text mining of Bioconductor packages metadata is a straight forward visual way to understand the relationships between packages. One could go beyond this and for example finding words that are especially important across package Descriptions by calculating tf-idf statistic. One could also set up a GitHub Action executed as a CRON job to get updates periodically. This could turn into a challenge for BiocChallenges.

Fundations of my motivation Early 2020, in a pre-pandemic world, I attended my first Rladies meetup in London by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel. Part of the reasons I decided to attended was because my husband was going to be away for the foreseeable months, so I decided to give myself the chance to connect with other Rladies. It was only few months before that meetup that I started using the Tidyverse, although I used R for many years in the past. It was a fantastic talk where I met some very cool Rladies and I got super impressed by Mine’s teaching abilities.\nDuring the past year, and because of continous lockdowns and WFH, I really dived into the Tidyverse: I joint LatinR talks, participated in Rladies Barcelona Florence Nightingale content, I watched Tidytuesday screencasts, opened a blog with Hugo, Rblogdown and Netlify (thanks to the amazing resources shared by Alison Hill). I could easily say that the Tidyverse mission 🛰 keep my mental health afloat during such difficult times.\nMoreover, during the summer of 2020 I got some formal teaching training from university of London where I learn concepts like Blooms taxonomy and I started to give by-weekly workshops for biology researcher co-workers of mine where I introduce them to ggplot2 and statistical concepts such as correlation.\nAll these things had a direct impact on my research career; for instance I published my first R package and gave my first EuroBioconductor short talk.\n Why I decided to become an RStudio Tidyverse I decided to get certificated for several reasons:\nGetting additional formal training on how to teach. I felt I and my audience could benefit more the better trained for training I would be. Pushing myself to really know inside out the Tidyverse. Getting the training forced me to read the R4DS book and doing the exercises thoroughly. I used additional fantastic resources such as https://datasciencebox.org/. Later, I learn that there are book clubs for some of the most popular R books, something that I somewhat missed, but I am very excited to join in 2021 the tidymodels book club organised by Jon Harmon.  The RStudio Instructor training journey has properly equipped me to do and teach data science! This process pushed me out of my comfort zone for which I will be forever grateful.\n During the training  Instructor training covering modern teaching methods. Materials for this training are available here  This was a two half days course where Greg Wilson lead such inspiring modules. What I like the most was feeling part of the learning community, the interactivity of the modules and genuinely learning about evidence-based effective teaching methods.\n Be nice, the rest is on the details –Greg\n  Between training and exam Materials Books. Reading the book Teaching Tech Together written by Greg. The book is currently undergoing translation into Spanish by a team of volunteers and I am honored to be among them thanks to Yanina Bellini Saibene.\n Guides. Going through R4DS instructor’s guide which has learning objectives and key points for each chapter of R4DS book.\n Concept maps. Building concept maps to design lessons taking into account cognitive load is a big part of the training. When preparing for the two exams I found this resource extremely useful to check I was building an accurate mental model of the topics covered in R4DS. I built myself quite a lot of mental models that you can find here\n  Greg also asked us to send an email with what we remember and so I did this concept map (there is a lot of information buried beneath my bad hand writing)\nWatching and reading other people’s experiences.

Subcellular proteomics is the method to study protein sub-cellular localization in a systematic manner. There are two complementary ways to analysis localized proteins:\n On one hand biochemical sub-cellular fractionation experiments allow empirical quantification of protein across sub-cellular and sub-organellar compartments. Proteins are allocated to a given subcellular niche if the detected intensity is higher than a threshold. We can say that this type of data has high signal-to-noise ratio, but is available in limited amounts (primary data).\n On the other hand, databases such as GO contain large amount of information about sub-cellular proteins localisation, but this is information is blended for a many biological systems. We can say that this type of data has high low signal-to-noise, but is available in large amounts (auxiliary data).\n  So we want to know how to optimally combine primary and auxiliary data.💹\nTo do so, we need to weight both types of data. If we imagine a multivariate distribution (like a Dirichlet distribution) were all the components take values between (0,1) and all values sum up to one, we can imagine that a weight of 1 indicates that the final annotation rely exclusively on the experimental data and ignore completely the auxiliary data and a weight of 0 represents the opposite situation, where the primary data is ignored and only the auxiliary data is considered.\nWe could use a transfer learning algorithm to efficiently complement the primary data with auxiliary data without compromising the integrity of the former. This is implemented in the pRoloc package and it was published by Breckels et al and expanded by Crook et al using a Bayesian approach. In this post I will step-by-step walk through KNN transfer learning.\n Getting the data We start with HEK293T2011 proteomics data available in the pRolocdata package.\ndata(HEK293T2011) The class of (HEK293T2011) isMSnSet instance, an efficient and established to store and handle MS data and metainformation efficiently. I am not going to discuss much about this class of objects since the field is moving towards other types of data storage such as SummarizedExperiment objects\nWe can also get an overview experimental data and query how many proteins across how many conditions were quantified.\nhead(exprs(HEK293T2011),2) ## X113 X114 X115 X116 X117 X118 X119 ## O00767 0.1360547 0.1495961 0.10623931 0.1465050 0.2773137 0.14294025 0.03796970 ## P51648 0.1914456 0.2052463 0.05661169 0.1651138 0.2366302 0.09964387 0.01803788 ## X121 ## O00767 0.003381233 ## P51648 0.027270640 dim(exprs(HEK293T2011)) ## [1] 1371 8 What is important to know is that 1371 proteins were quantified across eight iTRAQ 8-plex labelled fractions ( one could know a bit more about the experiment with ?HEK293T2011)\nNext thing we can do is see how well these organelles have been resolved in the experiment using a PCA plot\nplot2D(HEK293T2011) addLegend(HEK293T2011, where = \u0026quot;topright\u0026quot;, cex = 0.6)  Figure 1: PCA plot of HEK293T2011 subcellular proteomics dataset  We see that some organelles such as cytosol and cytosol/nucleus are well resolved - and so they will get a high weigh- while others such as the Golgi or the ER are less so - so they will get a low weight. There are some proteins that do not get annotation because the resolution of the experiment did not allow so.\n Quetting auxiliary annotation (Biomart Query) Next thing we can do is get auxiliary data. We can do so by querying biomaRt and storing the annotation as an AnnotationParams object.

Note that this figure is the result using extensive optimisation on the whole HEK293T2011 dataset and auxiliary HEK293T2011goset dataset, not only with only a random subset of 50 candidate weights.\n We see that the cytosol and cytosol/nucleus and ER are predominantly scored with high heights, consistent with high reliability of the primary data. Golgi, PM and the 40S ribosomal clusters are scored with smaller scores, indicating a substantial benefit of the auxiliary data.\nThe best grid search parameters can be accessed with:\ngetParams(topt) Note that the data HEK293T2011 gets annotated with the best parameters at the knntlOptimisation step.
