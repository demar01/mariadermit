These data is the published work of a chemistry lab. These data is something very close to what we would get in a proteomics lab, and the first thing we tend to do to explore these complex data is to do a PCA to have a simplify idea of its overall distribution in the reduced space.\nEDA data(oils) str(oils) ## tibble [96 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame) ## $ palmitic : num [1:96] 9.7 11.1 11.5 10 12.2 9.8 10.5 10.5 11.5 10 ... ## $ stearic : num [1:96] 5.2 5 5.2 4.8 5 4.2 5 5 5.2 4.8 ... ## $ oleic : num [1:96] 31 32.9 35 30.4 31.1 43 31.8 31.8 35 30.4 ... ## $ linoleic : num [1:96] 52.7 49.8 47.2 53.5 50.5 39.2 51.3 51.3 47.2 53.5 ... ## $ linolenic : num [1:96] 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.3 0.3 2.4 0.4 0.4 0.2 0.3 ... ## $ eicosanoic: num [1:96] 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 ... ## $ eicosenoic: num [1:96] 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.5 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 ... ## $ class : Factor w/ 7 levels \u0026quot;corn\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;olive\u0026quot;,..: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 ... oils %\u0026gt;% count(class) ## # A tibble: 7 x 2 ## class n ## * \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 corn 2 ## 2 olive 7 ## 3 peanut 3 ## 4 pumpkin 37 ## 5 rapeseed 10 ## 6 soybean 11 ## 7 sunflower 26 This looks like fun dataset to project in a reduced dimension space like PCA or UMAP!\n  PCA in base R The steps to generate the components for PCA in base R would be:\npca_res \u0026lt;- oils %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(where(is.numeric)) %\u0026gt;% # select only the numeric variables tidyr::drop_na() %\u0026gt;% # to drop any NA scale() %\u0026gt;% # to initially normalise the variances prcomp() # to convert numeric data to principal components pca_res ## Standard deviations (1, .., p=7): ## [1] 1.78631393 1.21432295 1.11849881 0.80775705 0.49010697 0.43543634 0.03437479 ## ## Rotation (n x k) = (7 x 7): ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 ## palmitic -0.1724393 -0.69299469 -0.04593832 0.46972220 -0.19508286 ## stearic -0.4589668 -0.25101419 -0.24289349 0.18544207 0.61204669 ## oleic 0.4578722 -0.39918199 0.14986398 -0.28962122 0.08386290 ## linoleic -0.4590266 0.44858975 -0.11564307 0.05114339 -0.07111895 ## linolenic 0.3446082 0.27607934 0.23426894 0.80580939 -0.02884460 ## eicosanoic 0.1682596 -0.01595516 -0.81991595 0.04591653 -0.46100031 ## eicosenoic 0.4384013 0.14034544 -0.41942317 0.08389933 0.60157904 ## PC6 PC7 ## palmitic -0.4661816 0.10904667 ## stearic 0.5067647 0.03928963 ## oleic 0.2409267 0.67792957 ## linoleic -0.2371904 0.71467174 ## linolenic 0.2916300 0.12220735 ## eicosanoic 0.2889776 0.03216008 ## eicosenoic -0.4929535 0.01587562 We can see that PC componennt for each class of oil were added in a prcomp object.\nAnd we could plot those component with autoplot\nautoplot(pca_res, data = oils, colour = \u0026quot;class\u0026quot;) + labs(color = NULL) We can see that this PCA separates olive oil far away from the other 7 types of oils. It also looks like one of the olive oils is closer to peanunt type of oil in the PCA space .\n PCA in Tidymodels Modeling is very much like cooking, and in the Tidymodels universe the language is reflects this very well 👨‍🍳. There are three things that we will need to do:\n Writing down a recipe 👩‍🍳 Preparing that recipe 🍝 Juicing the recipe ☕  Writing down a recipe We write down the recipe by adding series of steps.\npca_rec \u0026lt;- recipe(~., data = oils) %\u0026gt;% # start writing the recipe with all the data update_role(class, new_role = \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% # to keep this column around but not include it in the model step_normalize(all_predictors()) %\u0026gt;% # to normalise the data step_pca(all_predictors()) # to convert numeric data to principal components As we see the steps that we need to follow to write the recipe are very similar to the steps followed in base R. However, this is not all. In fact, if we explore how the recipe looks like:\npca_rec ## Data Recipe ## ## Inputs: ## ## role #variables ## id 1 ## predictor 7 ## ## Operations: ## ## Centering and scaling for all_predictors() ## No PCA components were extracted. We can see that the design matrix with id and predictor variables was created. The recipe tells us that the No PCA components were extracted. This is because a recipe specifies what we want to do, but it doesn’t really do anything to the data yet. We need to extract those components by preparing the recipe.\n Preparing that recipe We can use the function prep for preparing to train this data recipe.

Note that autoplot adds some information to the plot such as providing PCs percentage. So what’s the point of using Tidymodels if is a such a long series of steps compared to base R? Well, Tidymodels integrates a lot of modular packages which facilitates creating and evaluating different models.\n  UMAP in Tidymodels In addition to PCA, we could plot a UMAP representation. To do that we would need a new recipe, one that includes a step specify UMAP dimension reduction technique; this step is naturally called step_umap. Once that we have this recipe, the process is the same.

PCA and UMAP are fundamentally different in that PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction algorithm whereas UMAP is non-linear. Moreover, there are few important parameters that can impact how the UMAP representation looks like. This is nicely explained in the README of umapr package from the ropenscilabs. You can see additional arguments offered by step_umap with ?step_umap. Also note that we have trained our models with a tiny set of data (we have not done resampling) and we have not evaluated their performance.\n Conclusionss The data processing for doing unsupervised machine learning with Tidymodels are very similar to base R. Linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms separate the data in the reduced space differently. Resampling and model evaluation could help to better understand how these models perform.\n ","date":1612396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612396800,"objectID":"30d4e7a0418b257e7d9fd80301daf2bb","permalink":"/2021-02-04-unsupervised-machine-learning/","publishdate":"2021-02-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2021-02-04-unsupervised-machine-learning/","section":"post","summary":"Create a recipe, prep it and juice it to do PCA and UMAP with Tidymodels.","tags":["r","modeldata","PCA","UMAP","tidymodels"],"title":"PCA and UMAP classification of vegetable oils with tidymodels \u0026 base R","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":"   Motivation Statistics of Bioconductor downloads Full details of Bioconductor packages Word network of Bioconductor packages Conclusions   library(BiocPkgTools) library(tidyverse) library(tidytext) library(widyr) library(igraph) library(ggraph) library(lubridate) library(emo) Motivation Bioconductor has a total of 5796 at the present day 2021-01-31.

We could use this metadata information to understand the connections between packages.\n Word network of Bioconductor packages The most informative variables about the packages are Title and Description so we can explore the connections between packages doing some text mining using a Tidytext approach.\nTo prepare our dataset we need to initially tokenize the text. The Wikipedia definition for tokenization on lexical analysis is as follows:\n Tokenization is the process of demarcating and possibly classifying sections of a string of input characters\n The sections can be words, sentence, ngram or chapter (for example if analysis a book). In this case we are gonna break down package Titles or Description into words using the function unnest_tokens. In addition, we can remove stop words (included in the Tidytext dataset).\nbpi_title \u0026lt;- bpi %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(Package, Title) %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(word, Title) %\u0026gt;% anti_join(stop_words) bpi_description \u0026lt;- bpi %\u0026gt;% dplyr::select(Package, Description) %\u0026gt;% unnest_tokens(word, Description) %\u0026gt;% anti_join(stop_words) Note that the number of words from Title is 11932 and the number of words from Description is 59370, so package Descriptions contain on average 5 times the words of package Titles.\nWe can have a look at how the tokenised titles for each package look like:\nbpi_title ## # A tibble: 11,932 x 2 ## Package word ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 a4 automated ## 2 a4 affymetrix ## 3 a4 array ## 4 a4 analysis ## 5 a4 umbrella ## 6 a4 package ## 7 a4Base automated ## 8 a4Base affymetrix ## 9 a4Base array ## 10 a4Base analysis ## # … with 11,922 more rows Them, we can use pairwise_count from the widyr package to count how many times each pair of words occurs together in the package Title. This function works as a mutate in that it takes the variables to compare and returns a tibble with the pairwise columns and an extra column called n containing the number of words co-occurrences. I think this function is very sweet 🍯!\nbpi_titlepairs \u0026lt;- bpi_title %\u0026gt;% pairwise_count(Package, word, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE) bpi_desciptionpairs \u0026lt;- bpi_description %\u0026gt;% pairwise_count(Package, word, sort = TRUE, upper = FALSE) This data is ready for visualization of network of co-occurring words in package Titles. We can use the ggraph package for visualizing this network. We are going to represent just the top co-occurring words, or otherwise we get a very populated network which is impossible to read.\nset.seed(1234) bpi_titlepairs %\u0026gt;% filter(n \u0026gt;= 6) %\u0026gt;% graph_from_data_frame() %\u0026gt;% ggraph(layout = \u0026quot;fr\u0026quot;) + geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n), edge_colour = \u0026quot;purple\u0026quot;) + geom_node_point(size = 5) + geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, point.padding = unit(0.2, \u0026quot;lines\u0026quot;)) + theme_void()+ theme(legend.position=\u0026quot;none\u0026quot;)+ labs(title = \u0026quot; Number of word co-ocurrences in packages titles\u0026quot;)  Figure 1: Word network in Bioconductor packages Titles  We see some clear and logical clustering of packages in this network.For example, DESEq and DESeq2 packages cluster together, as one would expect since they DESeq2 is the successor of DESeq. There are other obvious connections such as MSstatsTMTPTM and MSstatsTMTP since the former has added functionality to analyse PTMs on TMT shotgun mass spectrometry-based proteomic experiments. There is a big cluster on the bottom left corner with packages to analyse RNASeq and single cell RNASeq.\nWhat about the network build from words of the Description?\nset.seed(1234) bpi_desciptionpairs %\u0026gt;% filter(n \u0026gt;= 15) %\u0026gt;% graph_from_data_frame() %\u0026gt;% ggraph(layout = \u0026quot;fr\u0026quot;) + geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n), edge_colour = \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;) + geom_node_point(size = 5) + geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, point.padding = unit(0.2, \u0026quot;lines\u0026quot;)) + theme_void()+ theme(legend.position=\u0026quot;none\u0026quot;)+ labs(title = \u0026quot;Number of word co-ocurrences in packages Description\u0026quot;)  Figure 2: Word network in Bioconductor packages Description  We see more connections here, and some of the relationships are still obvious (e.g HiCcompare and multiHiCcompare, anota and anota2seq, AnnotationHub and ExperimentHub). This network is richer, and one would have to dive a bit deeper to get a better sense of this network.\n Conclusions Text mining of Bioconductor packages metadata is a straight forward visual way to understand the relationships between packages. One could go beyond this and for example finding words that are especially important across package Descriptions by calculating tf-idf statistic. One could also set up a GitHub Action executed as a CRON job to get updates periodically. This could turn into a challenge for BiocChallenges.

Fundations of my motivation Early 2020, in a pre-pandemic world, I attended my first Rladies meetup in London by Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel. Part of the reasons I decided to attended was because my husband was going to be away for the foreseeable months, so I decided to give myself the chance to connect with other Rladies. It was only few months before that meetup that I started using the Tidyverse, although I used R for many years in the past. It was a fantastic talk where I met some very cool Rladies and I got super impressed by Mine’s teaching abilities.\nDuring the past year, and because of continous lockdowns and WFH, I really dived into the Tidyverse: I joint LatinR talks, participated in Rladies Barcelona Florence Nightingale content, I watched Tidytuesday screencasts, opened a blog with Hugo, Rblogdown and Netlify (thanks to the amazing resources shared by Alison Hill). I could easily say that the Tidyverse mission 🛰 keep my mental health afloat during such difficult times.\nMoreover, during the summer of 2020 I got some formal teaching training from university of London where I learn concepts like Blooms taxonomy and I started to give by-weekly workshops for biology researcher co-workers of mine where I introduce them to ggplot2 and statistical concepts such as correlation.\nAll these things had a direct impact on my research career; for instance I published my first R package and gave my first EuroBioconductor short talk.\n Why I decided to become an RStudio Tidyverse I decided to get certificated for several reasons:\nGetting additional formal training on how to teach. I felt I and my audience could benefit more the better trained for training I would be. Pushing myself to really know inside out the Tidyverse. Getting the training forced me to read the R4DS book and doing the exercises thoroughly. I used additional fantastic resources such as https://datasciencebox.org/. Later, I learn that there are book clubs for some of the most popular R books, something that I somewhat missed, but I am very excited to join in 2021 the tidymodels book club organised by Jon Harmon.  The RStudio Instructor training journey has properly equipped me to do and teach data science! This process pushed me out of my comfort zone for which I will be forever grateful.\n During the training  Instructor training covering modern teaching methods. Materials for this training are available here  This was a two half days course where Greg Wilson lead such inspiring modules. What I like the most was feeling part of the learning community, the interactivity of the modules and genuinely learning about evidence-based effective teaching methods.\n Be nice, the rest is on the details –Greg\n  Between training and exam Materials Books. Reading the book Teaching Tech Together written by Greg. The book is currently undergoing translation into Spanish by a team of volunteers and I am honored to be among them thanks to Yanina Bellini Saibene.\n Guides. Going through R4DS instructor’s guide which has learning objectives and key points for each chapter of R4DS book.\n Concept maps. Building concept maps to design lessons taking into account cognitive load is a big part of the training. When preparing for the two exams I found this resource extremely useful to check I was building an accurate mental model of the topics covered in R4DS. I built myself quite a lot of mental models that you can find here\n  Greg also asked us to send an email with what we remember and so I did this concept map (there is a lot of information buried beneath my bad hand writing)\nWatching and reading other people’s experiences.

Subcellular proteomics is the method to study protein sub-cellular localization in a systematic manner. There are two complementary ways to analysis localized proteins:\n On one hand biochemical sub-cellular fractionation experiments allow empirical quantification of protein across sub-cellular and sub-organellar compartments. Proteins are allocated to a given subcellular niche if the detected intensity is higher than a threshold. We can say that this type of data has high signal-to-noise ratio, but is available in limited amounts (primary data).\n On the other hand, databases such as GO contain large amount of information about sub-cellular proteins localisation, but this is information is blended for a many biological systems. We can say that this type of data has high low signal-to-noise, but is available in large amounts (auxiliary data).\n  So we want to know how to optimally combine primary and auxiliary data.💹\nTo do so, we need to weight both types of data. If we imagine a multivariate distribution (like a Dirichlet distribution) were all the components take values between (0,1) and all values sum up to one, we can imagine that a weight of 1 indicates that the final annotation rely exclusively on the experimental data and ignore completely the auxiliary data and a weight of 0 represents the opposite situation, where the primary data is ignored and only the auxiliary data is considered.\nWe could use a transfer learning algorithm to efficiently complement the primary data with auxiliary data without compromising the integrity of the former. This is implemented in the pRoloc package and it was published by Breckels et al and expanded by Crook et al using a Bayesian approach. In this post I will step-by-step walk through KNN transfer learning.\n Getting the data We start with HEK293T2011 proteomics data available in the pRolocdata package.\ndata(HEK293T2011) The class of (HEK293T2011) isMSnSet instance, an efficient and established to store and handle MS data and metainformation efficiently. I am not going to discuss much about this class of objects since the field is moving towards other types of data storage such as SummarizedExperiment objects\nWe can also get an overview experimental data and query how many proteins across how many conditions were quantified.\nhead(exprs(HEK293T2011),2) ## X113 X114 X115 X116 X117 X118 X119 ## O00767 0.1360547 0.1495961 0.10623931 0.1465050 0.2773137 0.14294025 0.03796970 ## P51648 0.1914456 0.2052463 0.05661169 0.1651138 0.2366302 0.09964387 0.01803788 ## X121 ## O00767 0.003381233 ## P51648 0.027270640 dim(exprs(HEK293T2011)) ## [1] 1371 8 What is important to know is that 1371 proteins were quantified across eight iTRAQ 8-plex labelled fractions ( one could know a bit more about the experiment with ?HEK293T2011)\nNext thing we can do is see how well these organelles have been resolved in the experiment using a PCA plot\nplot2D(HEK293T2011) addLegend(HEK293T2011, where = \u0026quot;topright\u0026quot;, cex = 0.6)  Figure 1: PCA plot of HEK293T2011 subcellular proteomics dataset  We see that some organelles such as cytosol and cytosol/nucleus are well resolved - and so they will get a high weigh- while others such as the Golgi or the ER are less so - so they will get a low weight. There are some proteins that do not get annotation because the resolution of the experiment did not allow so.\n Quetting auxiliary annotation (Biomart Query) Next thing we can do is get auxiliary data. We can do so by querying biomaRt and storing the annotation as an AnnotationParams object.

Note that this figure is the result using extensive optimisation on the whole HEK293T2011 dataset and auxiliary HEK293T2011goset dataset, not only with only a random subset of 50 candidate weights.\n We see that the cytosol and cytosol/nucleus and ER are predominantly scored with high heights, consistent with high reliability of the primary data. Golgi, PM and the 40S ribosomal clusters are scored with smaller scores, indicating a substantial benefit of the auxiliary data.\nThe best grid search parameters can be accessed with:\ngetParams(topt) Note that the data HEK293T2011 gets annotated with the best parameters at the knntlOptimisation step.
